# JVM_monitoring_springbatch_POC


Developed a Spring Batch Proof of Concept (POC) that optimized large-scale data processing by implementing batch processing techniques, reducing overall processing time by up to 40%. Integrated Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive JVM monitoring, enabling real-time performance tracking and resource optimization. Leveraged Spring Batch framework to efficiently manage and process extensive datasets, improving application scalability and performance.
